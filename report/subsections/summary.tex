This document details a hybrid testing methodology for securing \verb|EIP-712| typed data signing and on-chain verification. 
The approach leverages the speed of \texttt{Foundry} for smart contract integrity combined with \texttt{JavaScript}/\texttt{Ethers.js} for realistic off-chain signature generation. 
Our generalized test suite is \textbf{open-source} and is designed for use across a multiple protocols.
This methodology provides a foundation that security researchers are encouraged to utilize and expand upon for developing new proofs of concept (\texttt{PoCs}).
